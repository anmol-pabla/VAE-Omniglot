# VAE-Omniglot
Science and Technology Councilâ€™s Summer Project 2020 under Brain and Cognitive Society, IIT Kanpur aiming to
compare Traditional ML with One-Shot Learning Algorithms.
Developed a Variational Auto Encoder in TensorFlow to generate images of Characters present in the OmniGlot
Dataset (20 images each for 964 characters) with Human Level Accuracy and Variability, also learned about One-Shot
Learning Algorithms like Bayesian Program Learning and Siamese neural network
